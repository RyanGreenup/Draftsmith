    -
- [ ] Handle broken symlinks
- [ ] Consider storing the katex as an attribute to reduce load times
    - Store the entire html skeleton in the preview or Markdown object
- WYSIWYM
    - Permit Toggleable:
        - Inline Images in the editor
        - Inline Math for all equations (not just popup)
    - Enter on a link should open that link in the same way that a hyperlink does
- Opening Links
    - Links should first check to see if a tab is already open with that target
    - Behaviour should be shared between WYSIWYM and Clicking the link in the preview
    - Insert
        - Handle Relative links from the current focused page :(

- Treesitter not Regex
- Wikilinks
- Remember split after following links
- Visit Tab instead
- As it stands index.md doesn't work.
- Config Option
    - Open New tab when follow link vs follow link in current tab
- Wikilinks
- Databases
    - Wikilinks to ID
    - DuckDB with ODBC
        - Optional support for postgres
- Datatables could be nice
    - Native Tables would be even nicer
- Allow Default view for split as opposed to overlay
- Visiting tab fails if base name matches

- Links
    - Currently links are resolved from the root of the notes directory
         - I could change this to resolve them relative to the current file, but this is simpler in terms of:
              - Inserting links from vim (e.g. resolve from cwd)
              - Following links with the code base logic (e.g. resolve from cwd)
              - Moving files makes it easier to update links
    - [ ] Slashes should be automatically replaced for the `os.path.sep`
- FTS
    - Should only index if the file hash changes
    - Use the same file open logic as insert link etc.
    - Progress bar for the user would be nice
        - Atleast a toast notification

## DONE
- Ctrl-K should insert a wikilink if so configured
    - Only if directories can be supported
